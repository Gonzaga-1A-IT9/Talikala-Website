<h1><b> I. INTRODUCTION</b></h1>
	<h2>A. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</h2>
		<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px;  font-size: 20px;">
					In the internet, many research claims that in composting, the ideal balanced Carbon to Nitrogen
				(C/N) ratio should be of around 25 - 30:1 where 25 - 30 grams of Carbon should be added for
				each 1 gram of Nitrogen, stating that if the compost has too much carbon compound, it will be
				drier and longer to break down, and on the other hand, if the compost has too much nitrogen
				compound, it will end up creating a slimy, and smelly compost. As we all know, composting is one
				way of ‘recycling’ organic wastes in order for it to be used as a kind of fertilizer for plants. In this
				study, we are trying to find out if indeed having an unbalanced Carbon-Nitrogen compound in a
				compost, besides its negative effect during the decomposing of the compost, would affect the
				growth of a plant if it’s being used as a fertilizer. Understanding if having an ‘unbalanced’ Carbon-
				Nitrogen compound on a compost would negatively affect the growth/overall health of a plant, is
				very important for we believe if in some situation, one accidentally produces a compost with an
				‘unbalanced’ Carbon-Nitrogen compound, knowing that the presence of the ‘unbalanced’
				compounds may affect or may not affect the growth and the overall health of the plant helps them
				to decide whether or not to pursue giving the compost to their plants.</p>
				
	<h2>B. STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</h2>
		<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 20px;">
				How will a compost, with an unbalanced Nitrogen-Carbon compound, affect the growth of a
				Avocado seedling(Persea Americana)?</p>
				
	<h2>C. HYPOTHESIS</h2>
		<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 20px;">
				IF an Avocado seedling is given a compost, with an unbalanced Nitrogen-Carbon compound as a
				fertilizer, THEN the Avocado seedling would still grow as fast as if it’s being given a compost with a
				balanced Nitrogen-Carbon compound as its fertilizer.</p>
						
	<h2>D. REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATUE</h2>
		<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 20px;">
				According to Akratos &amp; Vayenas (2017), the right Carbon-Nitrogen ratio of a compost is of around
				25 - 30:1 where 25 - 30 grams of Carbon should be added for each 1 gram of Nitrogen, stating
				that if the compost has too much carbon compound, it will be drier and longer to break down, and
				on the other hand, if the compost has too much nitrogen compound, it will end up creating a
				slimy, and smelly compost. Indeed having an unbalanced Nitrogen-Carbon ratio on a compost
				would greatly negatively affect the compost itself in various ways(composting duration,
				appearance, and texture), but will it negatively affect a growth of a plant too if used as a
				fertilizer(considering that it attains an unbalanced Nitrogen-Carbon compound)?<br><br>
				In this study, we are claiming that despite the fact that the compost given to the plant has an
				‘unbalanced’ Nitrogen &amp; Carbon compound, its effects on the plant as a fertilizer would still be as
				effective as a compost with a ‘balanced’ Nitrogen-Carbon compound and it would not affect the
				plant in any way negatively, for having an ‘unbalanced’ Nitrogen &amp; Carbon in a compost would
				only affect the compost itself, specifically, on its composting duration, appearance, and texture.</p>
